Hi, I am Paul I'm a recent grad from biomedical engineering in Canada. 

I'm interested in signal/image analysis, cryptography, data science, embbeded systems, and finance.

This library will contain scripts for specific functions and tests. I'm looking to collaborate in medical applications as well as financial open source projects.
